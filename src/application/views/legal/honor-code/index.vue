			Stranerd’s Honour Code aims to communicate academic integrity in the Stranerd learning process and seeks to
			maintain the highest standards of conduct while improving learning.
			This Honour Code defines the expected standards which must be adhered to by all parties involved, in the
			conduct of academic affairs on Stranerd.

			Stranerd embodies a spirit of trust, honesty amongst others, which is central to facilitating the learning
			process of every academic. Stranerd’s vision is one that intends to facilitate learning but the adoption of
			good learning habits and discipline. Our core values are embedded in the very letters of our name:
