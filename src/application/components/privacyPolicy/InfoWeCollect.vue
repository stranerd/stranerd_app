				It is possible at times when collecting non-personally identifiable information through automatic means
				that we may unintentionally collect or receive personally
				identifiable information that is mixed in with the non-personally identifiable information. While we
				will make reasonable efforts to prevent such incidental data collection, the possibility still exists.

			<p>
				A cookie is simply a small file which holds a certain amount of data that our site sends to your device;
				it is afterwards stored on your device and can be accessed by our server to enable us to customize our
				services according to your needs.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may send one or more cookies to your device to enable us to uniquely identify your browser. We may
				use cookies (and similar items such as clear gifs,
				web beacons, tags, etc.) on our Service to customize your visit and for other purposes to make your
				visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our Service.
				We may also use and place cookies (and similar items) on your computer from our third party service
				providers in connection with the Service,
				such as an analytics provider that helps us manage and analyze Service usage, as described more fully
				below. In addition, our advertisers and
				business partners may set cookies and similar items on your computer when you use our Service.
			</p>
			<p>
				While most browsers automatically accept cookies, you still have the right to refuse cookies or be
				notified before you accept a cookie.
				Some features may not work properly if you do not allow cookies. Accepting our cookies enables us to
				retain your past choices and User preferences in order to make browsing easier
				as you do not have to make repetitive choices. Disallowing cookies still allows you to use our Service,

				Analytics and Conversion Tracking
			</h6>
			<p>
				We may use analytics services that use cookies, javascript and similar technologies to help us analyze
				how users
				use the Service. The information generated by these services about your use of the Service (including
				your IP
				address or a truncated version of your IP address) is transmitted to and stored by analytics service
				providers on their servers
				. Those service providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your, and other
				users’, use of the Service,
				compiling reports for us on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity
				and Internet usage.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may collect information about your computer, including your IP address, operating system and browser
				type,
				for system administration and in order to create reports. This is statistical data about our users’
				browsing actions and patterns, and does not identify any individual.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, we use cookies on our site for Google Analytics (the “Analytics Service”). The Analytics
				Service is a web-based analytics tool that helps website owners
				understand how visitors engage with their website. The Analytics Service customers can view a variety of
				reports about how visitors interact with their website so that they can improve it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Like many services, the Analytics Service uses first-party cookies to track visitor interactions as in
				our case, where they are used to collect information
				about how visitors use our site. We then use the information to compile reports and to help us improve
				our site.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive. These cookies are used to
				store information, such as the time that the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the
				site before and what site referred the visitor to the web page.
				<br><br>
				The Analytics Service collects information anonymously. They report website trends without identifying
				individual visitors. You can opt out of the Analytics Service without affecting how you visit our site.
				For more information on opting out of being tracked by Google Analytics across all websites you use,
				visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
				<br> <br>
				We may also use Google conversion tracking and/or similar services to help us understand your and other
				users’ use of the Service.

				unique User ID, device type, device identifiers, browser types and language, referring and exit pages,
				platform type, version of software installed, system type, the content and pages that you access on the
