			The security of your personally identifiable information is very important to us. When we collect your
			personally identifiable information online, we use reasonable efforts to protect it from unauthorized
			access.
			However, due to the inherently open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your personally
			identifiable information will be completely free from unauthorized access by third

			in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect.
			<br> <br>

			We do not share your personal information with their parties without your explicit consent. We will only
			share your information with the belief that sharing, storage or disclosure of that information is necessary.

			For legal reasons, including and not restricted to applicable rules and regulation
			For external processing with affiliate services
			For investigation of fraud or security threats or issues
			Protect our rights, property and safety as regards to our users or permissible by law

			We take particular care and put proper security measures in place to protect against unauthorized access or
			tampering with data. With insights gained from using our services, we are able to detect and prevent any
			security threats from ever reaching you.

			We regularly improve and review our security measures including internal reviews of our data collection,
			storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures in order to
			protect against unauthorized access to systems where we store private data.

			Your personal information possesses restricted access to our employees, contractors or agents who require
			access to that information in order to perform their duties or improve our services. These agents or
			contractors are bound by strict and confidential agreements and will be subject to discipline, including
			termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

			regularly review our data collection,
			storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect our store information which is necessary for
			us to provide or improve our services. <br> <br>
			When we become aware that personally identifiable information from a child under 13 has been collected
			without such a child's parent or guardian’s consent,
			we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.
